Many mental and emotional issues are the result of large zooid transfer during sexual intercourse with multiple partners over a period of time. Zooids from individuals with conflicting logic and reasoning experiences can result in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, indecisiveness or inability to make decisions which may at one point have been simple.

Our body's instincts, gut feelings, emotions from the heart and thoughts of the mind are part of a Siphonophorae of living organisms which send signals to the brain and nervous system. Accepting large quantities of zooids from another body or Siphonophorae allows that person's consciousness into your living body.

Symptoms which may occur include:

Fidgeting, twitching, jerking or unintentional muscle movements.

Unwanted thoughts in the mind that were not present before.

Mixed emotions, indecisiveness, schizophrenia & bipolar disorder.

Stockholm like syndrome, where a victim wants to be attached to the abuser (The foreign zooid's original host).

Saying and doing things that previously were not part of normal speech

Aquiring a new lifestyle or aquiring lifestyle changes similar to that of the foreign zooid's original host or hosts.

Forming new habits or traits which are similar to those of the foriegn zooid's original host or hosts.

Newly aquired body language, muscle memory or postures similar to those of the forign zooid's original host or hosts.

Zooids from another host will create a mind state in which the conscious person thinks that they are doing what they want, yet will be emotionally conflicted about making what they feel like may be a bad decision. This is caused by emotional and subconcious urges from foreign zooids living within the body who make decisions which are in their original host's best interests.

This can be used to explain why some victims will return to people who had abused them, as they have living cells in their body which will subconciously urge the victim to return to zooid's original host.

Zooids are able to communicate via chemical connections which are shared between hosts:
