# Foreign-Zooids-Resulting-in-Mental-Health-Issues
Many mental and emotional issues are the result of large zooid transfer during sexual intercourse with multiple partners over a period of time. Zooids from individuals with conflicting logic and reasoning experiences can result in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, indecisiveness or inability to make decisions which may at one point have been simple.

Our body's instincts, gut feelings, emotions from the heart and thoughts of the mind are part of a Siphonophorae of living organisms which send signals to the brain and nervous system. Accepting large quantities of zooids from another body or Siphonophorae allows that person's conciousness into your living body. 

Symptoms which may occur include:

Fidgeting, twitching, jerking or unintentional muscle movements.

Unwanted thoughts in the mind that were not present before.

Mixed emotions, indecisiveness, chizophrenia & bipolar disorder.

Stockholm like syndrome, where a victim wants to be attached to the abuser (The foreign zooid's original host).

Zooids from another host will create a mindstate in which the concious person thinks that they are doing what they want, yet will be emotionally conflicted about making what they feel like may be a bad decision. This is caused by emotional and intellectual urges from foreign zooids living within the body who make decisions which are in their original host's best interests.
